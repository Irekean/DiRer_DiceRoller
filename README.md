# Discord-Dice-Roller

# bot.py
The main Discord bot used to roll dices for tabletop games - WIP

# dice.py
The codes where the rolls are made, for now it uses everytime the actual timestamp as seed, in future will change in a similar way on how random.org works

# log.py
A simple console logger for the bot side

# readme.txt
A file like that should be created and put there just the bot token
